% POSITION ESTIMATOR TRAINING FUNCTION
%
% Trains a full decoding model to estimate hand positions from neural spikes.
% Pipeline:
%   1. Preprocesses neural data:
%       - Pads all trials to max length
%       - Bins spikes in 20 ms intervals
%       - Applies smoothing filter (EMA or Gaussian)
%   2. Removes neurons with low firing rate (< 0.5 spk/s)
%   3. Extracts features and assigns direction labels
%   4. Applies PCA for dimensionality reduction
%   5. Applies LDA to find class-discriminative features
%   6. Stores features and labels for later kNN decoding
%   7. Trains a regression model (PCR - ridge and lasso optional) to map spikes to (x,y)
%
% Outputs:
%   modelParameters - struct storing all learned parameters:
%       - preprocessing config
%       - removed neurons
%       - PCA/LDA matrices
%       - regression coefficients

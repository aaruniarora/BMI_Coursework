%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Preprocessing function for spike trains
%
% Input:
%   training_data - original neural dataset with spikes and hand positions
%   bin_group     - number of ms per time bin (e.g., 20 ms)
%   filter_type   - 'EMA' or 'Gaussian'
%   alpha         - EMA smoothing constant (0 < alpha < 1)
%   sigma         - std deviation for Gaussian smoothing (in ms)
%   debug         - if 'debug', plots are shown
%
% Output:
%   preprocessed_data - struct with binned, smoothed firing rates per trial
%
% Steps:
%   1. Pads all trials to max trial time length
%   2. Bins spike counts over `bin_group` intervals
%   3. Applies square root transform
%   4. Applies either a recursive filter, exponential moving average (EMA),
%      or Gaussian smoothing

# Neural Decoding Competition â€” BMI Spring 2025

Welcome to our submission for the Neural Decoding Competition hosted as part of the Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) course at Imperial College London!
This project involves designing a causal neural decoder to estimate a monkey's 2D hand trajectory (X and Y) based on spike train data from 98 neural units.

### Project Overview
- Input: Spike trains (1 kHz) from 98 neural units
- Output: Hand trajectory (X, Y) in mm
- Task: Continuous hand position estimation without using future data
- Scoring: RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) in cm
